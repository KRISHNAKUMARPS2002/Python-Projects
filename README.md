# Python-Projects
Here i uploaded the basic level projects using python.

1)Image Resizer with OpenCV
This Python script uses the OpenCV library to resize an image and save the result to a new file. It's a simple utility for scaling down an image based on a specified percentage.

# Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required library using: `pip install opencv-python`
3. Replace the `source` and `destination` variables with the appropriate file paths or names.
4. Adjust the `scale_percent` variable to set the desired scaling percentage.
5. Run the script.

```bash
python image_resizer.py

2) PDF Merger
This Python script uses the PyPDF2 library to merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF.

# Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required library using: `pip install PyPDF2`
3. Replace the `pdfiles` list with the names of the PDF files you want to merge.
4. Run the script.

```bash
python pdf_merger.py

3) RoboSpeaker
RoboSpeaker is a Python script that utilizes the pyttsx3 library to convert text to speech.

# Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required library using: `pip install pyttsx3`
3. Run the script.

```bash
python robo_speaker.py

4) Weather Information with Text-to-Speech
This Python script uses the `requests`, `json`, and `pyttsx3` libraries to fetch and announce the current weather information for a given city.

# Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using: `pip install requests pyttsx3`
3. Run the script.
